        <p>
            Hi there! Welcome to my first website. <br>
            I'm currently enrolled in Flatiron School for the Software Engineering bootcamp. 
            My goal is to develop the skills needed to build and improve user applications.
            I've worked in advertising for the last 8 years managing programmatic digital campaigns for a lot of major clients.
            <br>On my free time, I enjoy hiking, hanging out with Wally<!--link to Wally div-->, and floral arranging!
